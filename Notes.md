# Notes
The preprocessing notebook is faulty. For example the rewards column is filled with ints and Bools but the notebook wants floats?
The multiprocessing "utils.parallelize_fnc_groups" does not seem to be working.

The requirements are insufficient, they just tell you to use tuff thats newer than xy version, but thats wrong.
- Tensorflow needs to be < 2.1
